### 2. Key Features ✅

#### Order Management
- Real-time order list with 30-second polling
- Order filtering by status and actionable items
- Detailed order view with complete information
- Status progression through delivery workflow

#### Photo Upload Flow
- R2 integration with pre-signed URLs
- Mobile camera capture with environment camera preference
- Photo preview before upload
- Automatic status update after successful upload

#### Bulk Operations (RFC-TREK-DRIVER-003)
- Multi-select checkboxes on actionable orders
- Bulk note dialog for common updates
- Select all/deselect all functionality
- Individual API calls orchestrated by frontend

#### Communication & Navigation
- WhatsApp deep links for customer contact
- Google Maps integration for pickup/dropoff navigation
- Note system for driver comments
- Geolocation integration for status updates

### 3. UI/UX Features ✅
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

## API Integration

### Required Backend Endpoints
All backend APIs from previous instruction sets are required:

1. `GET /api/driver/:driverId/orders/assigned` (IS14)
2. `POST /api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/accept` (IS15)
3. `POST /api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/reject` (IS15)
4. `POST /api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/update-status` (IS15)
5. `POST /api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/add-note` (IS15)
6. `POST /api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/request-upload-url` (IS16)

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Backend API errors
- File upload failures
- Authentication/authorization errors

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. **Backend Setup**: Ensure worker backend is running with all driver APIs
2. **Database Setup**: Have a Mitra, Service, Driver, and assigned Order in the database
3. **Development Server**: Run `pnpm --filter fe-driver-view dev`

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Basic Order List Access
```bash
# Get driver CUID from database
# Navigate to: http://localhost:5175/view/[DRIVER_CUID]
```
**Expected**: Order list loads with assigned orders, polling updates every 30 seconds

#### 2. Order Actions Testing
- **Accept Order**: Click "Accept Order" button on DRIVER_ASSIGNED orders
- **Reject Order**: Click "Reject" and provide optional reason
- **Status Updates**: Progress through status workflow
- **Photo Upload**: Test camera capture and R2 upload flow

#### 3. Bulk Operations Testing
- Select multiple actionable orders using checkboxes
- Click "Add Note to Selected Orders"
- Enter bulk note (e.g., "Terjebak macet di area Sudirman")
- Verify note appears in order events

#### 4. Navigation & Communication
- **Maps Links**: Click "Open in Maps" for pickup/dropoff locations
- **WhatsApp Links**: Click "Contact Customer" to test deep links
- **Order Details**: Navigate to detailed order view

#### 5. Mobile Testing
- Test on mobile browser or device emulator
- Verify camera capture works with `capture="environment"`
- Test touch interactions and responsive layout
- Verify geolocation prompts for status updates

### Error Testing
1. **Network Issues**: Disable network, verify error handling
2. **Invalid Driver**: Use invalid driver ID in URL
3. **Upload Failures**: Test with large files or network interruption
4. **API Errors**: Mock backend errors to test error displays

## Performance Verification

### Key Metrics
- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds on 3G
- **Order List Refresh**: < 1 second
- **Photo Upload**: Progress indication, < 30 seconds
- **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between views

### Monitoring
- Network request timing in dev tools
- React Query cache behavior
- Bundle size optimization
- Mobile performance on real devices

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Code Quality ✅
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Error boundary implementation
- Proper loading states
- Accessible UI components

### Security ✅
- Driver authentication via URL parameter
- API error handling without data exposure
- Secure file upload to R2
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance ✅
- Code splitting by route
- Query caching with TanStack Query
- Image optimization for previews
- Minimal bundle size

### Mobile Optimization ✅
- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Camera integration
- Offline error handling

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Verification**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/fe-driver-view
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Cloudflare Pages Setup**:
   - Connect Git repository
   - Build command: `pnpm build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Environment variables: None required

3. **Testing in Production**:
   - Verify API proxy configuration
   - Test with real driver CUIDs
   - Confirm R2 upload functionality
   - Test on various mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Driver Not Found**: Verify driver CUID exists and is active
2. **Orders Not Loading**: Check backend API availability
3. **Photo Upload Fails**: Verify R2 configuration and pre-signed URLs
4. **Location Access Denied**: Handle gracefully without breaking flow

### Debug Tools
- React Query Devtools (enabled in development)
- Browser Network tab for API calls
- Console logs for geolocation and camera issues
- Mobile browser remote debugging

## Next Steps

### Post-MVP Enhancements
1. **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality
2. **Push Notifications**: Real-time order assignment alerts
3. **Advanced Routing**: Optimal route planning for multiple orders
4. **Performance Analytics**: User behavior tracking
5. **PWA Features**: Install prompt, background sync

### Integration Points
- **Mitra Admin**: Order assignment workflow
- **User Public**: Order tracking updates
- **Analytics**: Driver performance metrics
- **Notifications**: WhatsApp Business API integration
