# Mitra Driver Management API Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Mitra Driver Management API (TREK-IMPL-API-MITRA-DRV-001), which provides comprehensive CRUD operations for managing drivers and their service assignments within the Treksistem platform.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`apps/worker/src/routes/mitra.drivers.ts`** - New comprehensive driver management routes
2. **`apps/worker/src/routes/mitra.ts`** - Updated to mount driver routes and remove simple driver endpoint
3. **`test-driver-api.sh`** - Comprehensive test script for all functionality

### API Endpoints Implemented

#### Driver CRUD Operations

| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/api/mitra/drivers`           | Create a new driver                          |
| `GET`  | `/api/mitra/drivers`           | List all drivers for the authenticated Mitra |
| `GET`  | `/api/mitra/drivers/:driverId` | Get a specific driver by ID                  |
| `PUT`  | `/api/mitra/drivers/:driverId` | Update a specific driver                     |

#### Service Assignment Operations

| Method   | Endpoint                                           | Description                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/api/mitra/drivers/:driverId/services`            | Assign a service to a driver       |
| `DELETE` | `/api/mitra/drivers/:driverId/services/:serviceId` | Unassign a service from a driver   |
| `GET`    | `/api/mitra/drivers/:driverId/services`            | List services assigned to a driver |

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**

- ✅ Update driver information with conflict checking
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

#### 2. **Service Assignment Management**

- ✅ Assign services to drivers
- ✅ Unassign services from drivers
- ✅ List assigned services for a driver
- ✅ Prevent duplicate assignments
- ✅ Cross-Mitra authorization checks

#### 3. **Security & Authorization**

- ✅ Mitra-scoped operations (drivers can only be managed by their owning Mitra)
- ✅ CUID2 ID validation
- ✅ Proper authentication middleware integration
- ✅ Cross-Mitra access prevention

#### 4. **Data Validation**

- ✅ Zod schema validation for all inputs
- ✅ CUID2 format validation for IDs
- ✅ Duplicate identifier prevention within Mitra scope
- ✅ Required field validation

#### 5. **Error Handling**

- ✅ Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Conflict detection (409 for duplicates)
- ✅ Not found handling (404 for missing resources)
- ✅ Validation errors (400 for invalid input)
- ✅ Authorization errors (403/404 for cross-Mitra access)

### Request/Response Examples

#### Create Driver

```bash
POST /api/mitra/drivers
Content-Type: application/json
X-Mock-User-Email: test-admin@example.com

{
  "identifier": "driver001",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "configJson": {
    "vehicleType": "motorcycle",
    "licensePlate": "B1234XYZ"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "fqkz0fcpqidqgtyubyats1o4",
    "mitraId": "ayjqozp88i8ux2ufkezxho8o",
    "identifier": "driver001",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "configJson": {
      "vehicleType": "motorcycle",
      "licensePlate": "B1234XYZ"
    },
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "2025-05-28T11:30:50.636Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-05-28T11:30:50.636Z"
  }
}
```

#### Assign Service to Driver

```bash
POST /api/mitra/drivers/fqkz0fcpqidqgtyubyats1o4/services
Content-Type: application/json
X-Mock-User-Email: test-admin@example.com

{
  "serviceId": "b3j7mc8hymi8nwg7vgvffu7f"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Service assigned to driver successfully."
}
```

### Database Schema Integration

The implementation properly integrates with the existing Drizzle schema:

- **`drivers` table**: Full CRUD operations with proper foreign key relationships
- **`driverServices` junction table**: Manages many-to-many relationships between drivers and services
- **`services` table**: Referenced for service assignment validation

### Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test-driver-api.sh`) has been created that covers:

1. **Happy Path Testing**

   - Driver creation, listing, updating
   - Service assignment and unassignment
   - Listing assigned services

2. **Error Case Testing**

   - Duplicate identifier handling
   - Invalid ID format validation
   - Cross-Mitra authorization
   - Non-existent resource handling

3. **Security Testing**
   - Authentication requirements
   - Authorization scoping
   - Cross-Mitra access prevention

### Verification Criteria Met

✅ **All CRUD operations for drivers function correctly, scoped to the authenticated Mitra**

- Drivers can only be created, read, updated by their owning Mitra
- Proper validation and error handling implemented

✅ **Service assignment/unassignment updates `driverServices` table correctly**

- Junction table properly managed
- Duplicate assignment prevention
- Clean unassignment with proper cleanup

✅ **Cannot assign a driver to a service not owned by the Mitra**

- Cross-Mitra validation implemented
- Both driver and service ownership verified before assignment

### Architecture Highlights

#### 1. **Modular Design**

- Separate route file for driver management
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable middleware integration

#### 2. **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript integration
- Zod schema validation
- Proper type inference from database schema

#### 3. **Developer Experience**

- Comprehensive error messages
- Consistent API response structure
- Clear validation feedback

#### 4. **Operational Excellence**

- Proper logging for debugging
- Performance-optimized queries
- Database transaction safety

### Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

1. **Driver Configuration Schema**: Could implement a more structured Zod schema for `configJson` if driver capabilities become more complex
2. **Bulk Operations**: Could add endpoints for bulk driver creation/assignment
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Could add query parameters for filtering drivers by status, service assignments, etc.
4. **Audit Trail**: Could integrate with the `orderEvents` pattern for driver management audit logs

## Conclusion

The Mitra Driver Management API has been successfully implemented with comprehensive CRUD operations, robust security, and thorough testing. The implementation follows best practices for API design, database integration, and error handling while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture.
