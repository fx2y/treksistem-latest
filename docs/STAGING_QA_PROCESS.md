# Treksistem Staging QA Process

This document outlines the Quality Assurance process for the Treksistem staging environment, including automated API verification and manual testing protocols.

## Overview

The staging QA process ensures that deployments to the staging environment are stable and functional before being promoted to production. It combines automated API testing with comprehensive manual testing across all user flows.

## Process Components

### 1. Automated API Verification

**Tool**: Newman (Postman CLI runner)
**Collection**: `postman/Treksistem_API_Working.postman_collection.json`
**Environment**: `postman/Staging_Sandbox.postman_environment.json`

#### Setup

1. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Update `baseUrl` in staging environment to actual staging worker URL
   - Configure `stagingUserEmail` with appropriate CF Access permissions
   - Ensure all dynamic variables are properly initialized

2. **Execution**:

   ```bash
   pnpm test:api:staging
   ```

3. **Report Review**:
   - Generated report: `postman/report-staging.html`
   - All tests must pass before proceeding with manual QA
   - Failed tests must be investigated and resolved

#### API Test Coverage

- **Health Check**: Worker availability and basic functionality
- **Mitra Flow**: Profile, service, and driver management
- **User Flow**: Order placement and tracking
- **Driver Flow**: Order management and status updates
- **Authentication**: Access control and authorization
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling

### 2. Manual QA Testing

**Checklist**: `docs/QA_CHECKLIST_STAGING.md`

#### Scope

- **Frontend Testing**: All three frontend applications
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design and touch interactions
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end user flows
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization

#### Execution Protocol

1. **Pre-testing Setup**:

   - Verify staging environment health
   - Ensure clean test data state
   - Confirm all services are accessible

2. **Test Execution**:

   - Follow checklist systematically
   - Document issues with screenshots/details
   - Test on multiple devices/browsers
   - Verify cross-flow integrations

3. **Issue Documentation**:
   - Use staging QA notes template
   - Include environment details
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Assign to appropriate team members

## Staging Environment Configuration

### Worker Configuration

- **URL**: `https://treksistem-api-staging.youraccount.workers.dev`
- **Environment**: `staging` (via `WORKER_ENV` variable)
- **Database**: `treksistem-d1-staging`
- **R2 Bucket**: `treksistem-proofs-staging`

### Frontend Applications

- **Mitra Admin**: `https://fe-mitra-admin-staging.pages.dev`
- **Driver View**: `https://fe-driver-view-staging.pages.dev`
- **User Public**: `https://fe-user-public-staging.pages.dev`

### Authentication

- **Mitra Admin**: Cloudflare Access (staging configuration)
- **Driver View**: CUID-based authentication
- **User Public**: No authentication required

## QA Execution Schedule

### Deployment-Triggered QA

**Trigger**: After every staging deployment
**Timeline**: Within 2 hours of deployment
**Scope**:

- Full automated API verification
- Focused manual testing on changed functionality
- Critical path verification

### Periodic Stability Checks

**Frequency**: Weekly
**Timeline**: Every Monday morning
**Scope**:

- Full manual QA checklist
- Performance monitoring
- Data consistency verification
- Environment health check

### Pre-Production QA

**Trigger**: Before production deployment
**Timeline**: 24 hours before production release
**Scope**:

- Complete QA checklist execution
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device testing
- Load testing (if applicable)

## Quality Gates

### Automated API Tests

- **Pass Criteria**: 100% of API tests pass
- **Failure Action**: Block manual QA until issues resolved
- **Escalation**: Notify development team immediately

### Manual QA Tests

- **Pass Criteria**: All critical flows functional
- **Acceptable Issues**: Minor UI issues that don't block functionality
- **Blocking Issues**: Authentication failures, data corruption, critical flow failures

### Performance Criteria

- **API Response Time**: < 2 seconds for 95% of requests
- **Frontend Load Time**: < 5 seconds for initial page load
- **File Upload**: < 30 seconds for typical photo uploads

## Issue Management

### Issue Classification

1. **Critical**: Blocks core functionality, security issues
2. **High**: Significant impact on user experience
3. **Medium**: Minor functionality issues
4. **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor UX improvements

### Resolution Process

1. **Issue Identification**: Document in QA notes template
2. **Triage**: Assign severity and priority
3. **Assignment**: Route to appropriate team member
4. **Tracking**: Monitor resolution progress
5. **Verification**: Re-test after fix deployment
