### 2.3 Order Tracking

- [ ] **Track Order**: GET `/api/orders/:orderId/track`
  - Verify sanitized order data returned
  - No sensitive information exposed (driver details minimal)
  - Order status shows as PENDING initially

## 3. üöó Driver Flow

### 3.1 Driver Authentication & Access

- [ ] **Access Driver View**: Navigate to `/driver-view/:driverId` in browser

### 3.2 Order Management

- [ ] **View Assigned Orders**: GET `/api/driver/:driverId/orders/assigned`
  - Initially empty until Mitra assigns order
- [ ] **Accept Order**: POST `/api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/accept`
  - Verify order status changes to ACCEPTED_BY_DRIVER
  - Check status update appears in user tracking
- [ ] **Reject Order** (test with another order): POST `/api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/reject`
  - Verify order becomes available for other drivers

### 3.3 Order Execution Flow

- [ ] **Update Status - Arrived at Pickup**:
  - POST `/api/driver/:driverId/orders/:orderId/update-status`
